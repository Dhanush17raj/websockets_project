# websockets_project

Our project is a website that would live track the different values of crypto-currencies. It will also predict the future values of crypto currencies.
We had used websockets for the live updation of the values of crypto-currencies. For predicting the values of crypto-currencies we used an LSTM. It is having both long-term and short-term memory, such that it could evaluate the future trends.

## If the value of crypto-currencies is displayed in green it means that value of the currency had increased from its previous value. If its red then the value of currency has decreased from its previous value.
